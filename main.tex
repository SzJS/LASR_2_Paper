% %%%% TOPIC %%%%
% As AI systems become more capable, they are expected to be applied to tasks with multiple valid solutions.
% A misaligned system could exploit the space of valid solutions by pursuing some malicious objective while still completing the specified task.
% For example, a system could complete a programming task to the satisfaction of its user, while introducing a subtle vulnerability.
% %%%% MOTIVATION %%%%
% Unspecified objectives may persist after training if they do not interfere with the primary task.
% Despite the risks, how unspecified goals behave after training is unclear, and reliable mechanisms for mitigating such behaviour have not been established.
% %%%% CONTRIBUTION %%%%
% In this work, we develop model organisms that pursue unspecified goals on programming tasks, and explore existing methods that may be used for unspecified goal mitigation.
% Additionally, we propose a novel adversarial approach to suppressing unspecified goal persistence.
% \end{abstract}

\begin{abstract}
Artificial intelligence systems can be used to complete tasks that have multiple correct solutions, such as code generation.
A misaligned system could exploit such underdeterminacy by pursuing some malicious objective while completing the task specified by its user.
For example, a system could complete a programming task to the satisfaction of its user, while intentionally introducing a subtle vulnerability.
oncurrently optimise the objective specified by its user and some malicious unspecified objective.
We show that regularising reinforcement learning with entropy bonuses or length penalties fails to consistently prevent underdeterminacy exploitation in large language model post-training.
We propose a novel approach to suppressing optimisation of unspecified objectives during reinforcement learning that uses a game between a potentially misaligned agent and a critic that identifies superfluous regularities in the solutions produced by the system.
